## About
This repository contains a machine learning model using KNN  to detect Parkinson's disease based on voice signals.

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to contribute to the development of early diagnostic tools for Parkinson's disease, which can significantly improve the quality of life for patients and their families.

## Method
- **Data**: The dataset consists of voice recordings of patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls.
- **Model**: The K nearst neighbor is used for classification.
- **Features**: The model uses vocal features extracted from the voice recordings.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
